Here's a topic that is controversial even among my own shifting opinions. Is a graduate degree in a technical field worth the trouble, time, and money?

I started a graduate EE degree a number of years back. I got about 4 classes in and then made a conscious decision to stop, or pause temporarily -- or so I told myself at the time. I have never started again, although I have thought about doing so many times and even got part way through the application process at a different school.

Why my reluctance? Mostly it comes down to what it will mean for my lifestyle, how it would affect my "free" time. Between work, household, and family responsibilities, I have precious little time remaining to pursue my own interests. Starting a graduate program would completely blow my personal time away, not to mention eat into my family time. And in the end, I'm just not convinced it would be a meaningful accomplishment.

I could be completely wrong about this

And I am amazed at how many times it has happened that something I have learned about by pursuing my own intersts ends up becoming relevant at work.

Undergraduate degree. For someone new to the field, it provides exposure to a wide breadth of toptics: electronics, signal processing, electro-magnetism, programming, computer architecture.
