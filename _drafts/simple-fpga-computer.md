### Goal
to design a very minimal computer with verilog.

### Platform
[Scarab Hardware Minispartan3](https://www.scarabhardware.com/minispartan3/)

[Lattice MachXO3LF Starter Kit](http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/DevelopmentBoardsAndKits/MachXO3LStarterKit.aspx)

### Resources
[A very simple 8-bit RISC processor for FPGA](http://www.dte.eis.uva.es/Datos/Congresos/FPGAworld2006a.pdf)

### Verilog
To begin with, a computer needs some random access memory to store instructions and variable values. Here is single port RAM with synchronous write and asynchronous read (the data output is always available when the address value is presented).
