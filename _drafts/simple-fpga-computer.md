Goal: to design a very minimal computer with verilog.

Platform:
[Scarab Hardware Minispartan3](https://www.scarabhardware.com/minispartan3/)
[Lattice MachXO3LF Starter Kit](http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/DevelopmentBoardsAndKits/MachXO3LStarterKit.aspx)

To begin with, a computer needs some random access memory to store instructions and variable values.
